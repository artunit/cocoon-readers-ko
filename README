Project: Imager reader

This a modification of the Cocoon ImageOp Reader suite, which
seems to be broken in trunk. A cocoon reader is useful for 
working with special generators, for example, combining with 
the zip generator:

[http://app.org/app/]img-foo.jpg-2.0-1-png

which maps to something like:

<map:match pattern="img-*-*-*-*">
   <map:read type="img-op-scale" src="jar:{realpath:/}files.zip!/{1}.jpg">
      <map:parameter name="scale-scale" value="{2}" />
      <map:parameter name="scale-align" value="{3}" />
      <map:parameter name="output-format" value="{4}" />
   </map:read>
</map:match>

The "scale-align" parameter defines where an image is chopped, where:

0 - passes through the image with the resizing
1 - passes through the first half of the image
2 - passes through the second half of the image

This comes in handy for newspaper processing.
